Second project for Coding Dojo

Learning to use the xtreme gradient boosting model and comparing it to random forest while considering optimizing routines to maximize predictive ability.  Routines considered for optimization are hyperparameter tuning, feature selection/engineering, and identifying sub-populations with identifieable unique characteristics that would allow for a more acurate model upon identfying said characteristics.
